# About Me

Hi! My name is Jovan, I'm an aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst currently based in Australia, with a strong interest in risk, governance, and hands-on technical learning. I’m currently studying cybersecurity at QUT while actively building my skills through platforms like TryHackMe and PentesterLab.

I enjoy working on home lab projects, and CTFs to explore real-world attack and defence scenarios, and I'm planning to regularly share both my projects and learnings through GitHub, including blogs aimed at improving GRC implementation and keeping up with cybersecurity trends.

I’ve attended many industry events to stay connected with the local cybersecurity community and expand my knowledge of current threats and innovations. I'm passionate about using technology to protect systems, reduce risk, and contribute to a safer digital environment.
