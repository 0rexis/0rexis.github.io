    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This is a research project that me and my supervisor is developing to understand how LLMs can assist in helping people do their risk assessemnts. Risk assessment is a crucial aspect of decision-making in many different sectors such as finance, healthcare, cybersecurity, and insurance. With how smart Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, Meta's Ollama, there's growing interest in how these powerful tools can support or even automate aspects of this process.</p>

    <h2>Why Use LLMs for Risk Assessment?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Natural language understanding:</strong> LLMs can process unstructured text data from reports, news, or internal documentation.</li>
      <li><strong>Pattern recognition:</strong> These models can identify trends and potential threats from large datasets.</li>
      <li><strong>Speed and scalability:</strong> LLMs can analyze vast amounts of data in seconds, supporting real-time decision-making.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Potential Applications</h2>
    <p>LLMs can assist in various areas of risk assessment, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Scanning legal and compliance documents for vulnerabilities</li>
      <li>Analyzing customer feedback or incident reports for early warning signs</li>
      <li>Generating risk summaries from raw incident logs</li>
      <li>Supporting auditors and analysts with interactive risk-related Q&A</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What are some problems with current LLMs with Risk Assessment?</h2>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>Here's how my supervisor and I thought of AI Agents that could help in the aspects of Risk Assessment</p>

    <h2>The project is still ongoing and conclusions are yet to be made</h2>
